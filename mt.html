	<h2>The Problem</h2>
	<div class="quote">At least 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water that is fecally contaminated.</div>
	<div class="information block">Clean, accessible water for all is an essential part of the world we want to live in. There is sufficient fresh water on the planet to achieve this. But due to bad economics or poor infrastructure, every year millions of people, most of them children, die from diseases associated with inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene. Water scarcity, poor water quality and inadequate sanitation negatively impact food security, livelihood choices and educational opportunities for poor families across the world. Drought afflicts some of the world’s poorest countries, worsening hunger and malnutrition.</div>

	<h2>The Situation in Africa</h2>
	<div class="quote">"Poverty in Africa is often caused by a lack of access to clean, safe water and proper sanitation."
		(The Water Project)</div>
	<div class="information block">There are a number of reasons why poverty has become an epidemic in Africa. Poverty can be the result of political instability, ethnic conflicts, climate change and other man-made causes.
		But one of the greatest causes of poverty in Africa is also the most overlooked... the lack of access to clean drinking water.</div>

	<h3>Population growth and rural-urban migration</h3>
	<div class="information block">Africa’s rising population is driving demand for water and accelerating the degradation of water resources in many countries on the continent. Among developing regions, Sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to have the highest prevalence of urban slums and it is expected to double to around 400 million by 2020. Despite the efforts of some Sub-Saharan African countries and cities to expand basic services and improve urban housing conditions. Rapid and unplanned urban growth has increased the number of settlements on unstable, flood-prone, and high-risk land where phenomena such as landslides, rains, and earthquakes have devastating consequences.</div>
	<h3>Economic development and poverty</h3>
	<div class="information block">Sub-Saharan Africa is the world’s poorest and least developed region, with half its population living on less than a dollar a day. About two-thirds of its countries rank among the lowest in the Human Development Index. Even when opportunities exist to address outstanding water issues, deep and widespread poverty across the African region constrains the ability of many cities and communities to provide proper water and sanitation services, sufficient water for economic activities and to prevent water quality from deteriorating.</div>

	<h2>What can we do?</h2>
	<div class="quote">“When students are freed from gathering water, they return to class. With proper and safe latrines, girls stay in school through their teenage years.”</div>
	<img src="mt/img/change-a-life.jpg" width="30%"><div class="caption">Image thanks to The Water Project</div>
	<div class="information block">Civil society organizations should work to keep governments accountable, invest in water research and development, and promote the inclusion of women, youth and indigenous communities in water resources governance. Generating awareness of these roles and turning them into action will lead to win-win results and increased sustainability and integrity for both human and ecological systems.
