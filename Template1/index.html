        <ul>
        <li><u>Gun Deaths in Florida (Reuters): BAD.</u>This image chooses to demonstrate the murders committed using firearms over time using a line graph, which is a reasonable choice to demonstrating a change over time. The axes are reasonably labeled and the main point of interest is explicitly labeled. This effectively draws attention to the intention of the chart. There is very little ink other than the information being demonstrated, making the graph uncluttered. However, the choice to flip the y axis makes this a bad visualization for communication purposes. The color red is used as an attempt to emphasize which side of the plot is "filled in" with data. Even so, it is insufficient. Because most line graph representations have lower values to the bottom, viewers instinctively think that the effect of the 2005 law was a decrease in gun deaths. This, of course, is the opposite point from what is intended from the plot. Thus, even though the plot looks relatively clear and avoids visual clutter, it, in context with viewer expectations of plotting conventions, is a <u>bad</u> way to communicate this message. Since the author was trying to emphasize the effect of the 2005 law on gun deaths, they've actually subverted their own goal. Merely flipping the y axis would have the desired effect. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/gun-deaths-in-florida-increased-with-stand-your-ground-2014-2">Source</a></li>
        <li><u>Callings (GRAAFF): BAD.</u> This visualization uses pie charts to compare percentages from different categories of respondents. While pie charts generally work well for percentage answers, in this case, these percentages are not part of the same total. For comparative purposes, stacking the pie charts and distorting the perspective in 3D make it difficult to perform visual comparisons. It is difficult to determine the percentage that each circle make up from a sideways perspective, especially since each pie has a slightly different angle. Since the goal of the author was to compare job satisfaction over different fields, a bar graph would have been preferred. Some of the pies are even different colors. The green pie is obviously colored for emphasis, as the author was comparing the job satisfaction of being a teacher to other jobs, but the other pies have slightly varying shades of red. This is dishonest and may cause viewers to believe the color represents another dimension of information, which is not the case here. <a href="http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php?title=File:Nytimes-callings.jpg">Source</a></li>
        <li><u>Who suffers most from travel stress? (CWT Solutions Group): GOOD. </u>The author of this visualization has chosen a simple, low-clutter scatter plot. The axes are clearly labeled and there is no ink on the actual plot other than data points (and an unobtrusive background color). The points are fairly easy to read, but the true purpose of the author is to determine whether there is a relationship between travel frequency and travel stress. Therefore, though the lack of grid lines technically make it more difficult to determine exact values, the goal of illustrating a trend, specifically that travel stress has a high variance for occasional travelers and that it doesn't necessarily go down for more frequent travelers, is successful due to the graph's simplicity. The viewer can easily interpret this information at a glance and the lack of clutter does not trick the viewer into thinking that there is more information present than there actually is. <a href="http://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/data-visualization-good-charts.html">Source</a></li>
        <li><u>Daily Routines (Podio): GOOD. </u>This plot uses blocks to break down 24-hour time periods for each person. These blocks are consistent for the entire visualization, using color for common elements throughout the entire visualization. This makes it easy for viewers to make comparisons between any two individuals. Another aspect that makes comparisons easy is stacking the bars directly above each other. This visualization is also low clutter; the only labels on each row are the names of the famous person. All other information has been reduced to color coding and relative sizing (with a scale at the very top). Reducing this clutter means that there is very little distracting from the data being presented. The simplicity and cohesion of this visualization makes it very successful as a tool for comparing different routines of famous people. <a href="https://podio.com/site/creative-routines">Source</a></li>
